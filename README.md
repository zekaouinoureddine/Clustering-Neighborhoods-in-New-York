# Clustering Neighborhoods in New York
Segmenting and Clustering Neighborhoods in New York City

## Overview

In this lab, we will learn how to convert addresses into their equivalent latitude and longitude values. Also, we will use the **Foursquare API** to explore neighborhoods in New York City. then we will use the **explore** function to get the most common venue categories in each neighborhood, and then use this feature to group the neighborhoods into clusters. we will use the **_k-means_** clustering algorithm to complete this task. Finally, we will use the **Folium** library to visualize the neighborhoods in New York City and their emerging clusters.

In the [jupyter notebook file](https://github.com/zekaouinoureddine/Clustering-Neighborhoods-in-New-York/blob/main/Clustering%20Neighborhoods%20in%20New%20York.ipynb) we will go over the steps bellow

ðŸ“Œ Please, you will not be able the maps generated in Jupyter Notebook specially in github ecosystem. So, you can either download the Jupyter Notebook file and try it yourself(PLEASE DO NOT USE MY PERSONAL ADRESSES FROM FOURSQUAR, PLEASE USE YOUR OWN) or you take a look on the tree images of the unseen maps, I downloaded the for you.
